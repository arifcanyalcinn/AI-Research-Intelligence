# Project Log

## Current Status

Current Phase: Phase 1
Current Batch: Batch 4 (Completed)
Architecture: Frozen (Frozen_SDS.md)

## Completed Batches

### Batch 1
Infrastructure

Summary

- Source registry infrastructure
- Plugin discovery
- Shared retry / timeout utilities

Validation

- Tests passed
- Ruff passed

---

### Batch 2
ArXiv Source

Summary

- ArXivSource implemented
- Atom parser
- Retry logic
- Health check
- Registry integration

Validation

- Pytest: 157 passed
- Ruff: PASS

---

## Architecture Decisions

- Synchronous pipeline
- Explicit plugin imports
- SQLite
- Telegram review stage
- Twitter publisher
- Shared build_client()
- Shared retry policy

---

## Technical Debt

- Library:
  respx==0.21.1

Known issue:

- Issue #277
- HTTP method bytes/str mismatch

Current workaround

- url__startswith matching

Remove after

- respx >= 0.22.0

* Implemented Daily Papers API integration
* Reused shared HTTP client (`build_client()`)
* Reused shared retry policy (`FETCH_RETRY`)
* Added payload normalization
* Added `health_check()`
* Registered plugin via `arip/sources/__init__.py`
* Added comprehensive unit tests

## Validation

* SDS compliance reviewed
* Architecture review completed
* Pytest: **218 / 218 passed**
* No architecture violations detected

## Git

# Batch 4 – HuggingFace Models & Spaces Sources

## Summary

Implemented the HuggingFace Models and HuggingFace Spaces source plugins
according to the Frozen SDS. Both are independent, direct `BaseSource`
subclasses reusing the Batch 1 infrastructure without modification.

## Implemented

* Added `HuggingFaceModelsSource` (`SourceType.MODEL`, authority 0.55)
* Added `HuggingFaceSpacesSource` (`SourceType.SPACE`, authority 0.45)
* Models API: `GET /api/models?sort=downloads&direction=-1&limit=50`
* Spaces API: `GET /api/spaces?sort=likes&direction=-1&limit=50`
* Reused shared HTTP client (`build_client()`)
* Reused shared retry policy (`FETCH_RETRY`)
* Reused shared hash helper (`compute_content_hash()`)
* Added payload normalization + tag→topic filtering
* Added `health_check()` to both
* Registered both plugins via `arip/sources/__init__.py`
* Added comprehensive unit tests (fixtures captured from live API responses)

## Decisions

* D-004 — Source plugins must inherit `BaseSource` directly (no intermediate
  base class), because `__subclasses__()` does not recurse.
* D-005 — Per-source fetch limit / sort key are module constants when the SDS
  types the source as plain `SourceConfig`.

## SDS References

* §1.2  — explicit plugin registration
* §4.2  — `source_type` MODEL / SPACE, `content_hash` formula
* §5.3  — `BaseSource` interface, retry / 401 / 429 failure modes
* §5.4  — `normalize()` as a source method
* §5.5  — engagement signal, source authority 0.55 / 0.45
* §5.15 — both sources typed as plain `SourceConfig`
* §6    — mandated file paths

## Files Changed

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `arip/sources/huggingface_models.py` | NEW — Models plugin |
| `arip/sources/huggingface_spaces.py` | NEW — Spaces plugin |
| `tests/unit/sources/test_huggingface_models.py` | NEW — Models tests |
| `tests/unit/sources/test_huggingface_spaces.py` | NEW — Spaces tests |
| `arip/sources/__init__.py` | MODIFIED — 2 registration imports (SDS §1.2) |

No config change required: `SourcesSettings`, `settings.yaml` and
`ranking.source_authority` already declared both sources in Batch 1.

## Technical Debt

See TECHNICAL_DEBT.md — items TD-003, TD-004, TD-005 added by this batch.

## Validation

* SDS compliance reviewed
* Architecture review completed
* Pytest: **363 / 363 passed** (218 pre-existing unchanged + 145 new)
* Ruff: no new errors introduced
* No architecture violations detected

* GitHub Trending Source

Prerequisites: none — Batch 1 infrastructure is sufficient.
`ARIP_GITHUB_TOKEN` is already declared in config for higher rate limits.
