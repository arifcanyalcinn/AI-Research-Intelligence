* Reused shared retry policy (`FETCH_RETRY`)
* Added payload normalization
* Added `health_check()`
* Registered plugin via `arip/sources/__init__.py`
* Added comprehensive unit tests

## Validation

* SDS compliance reviewed
* Architecture review completed
* Pytest: **218 / 218 passed**
* No architecture violations detected

## Git

# Batch 4 – HuggingFace Models & Spaces Sources

## Summary

Implemented the HuggingFace Models and HuggingFace Spaces source plugins
according to the Frozen SDS. Both are independent, direct `BaseSource`
subclasses reusing the Batch 1 infrastructure without modification.

## Implemented

* Added `HuggingFaceModelsSource` (`SourceType.MODEL`, authority 0.55)
* Added `HuggingFaceSpacesSource` (`SourceType.SPACE`, authority 0.45)
* Models API: `GET /api/models?sort=downloads&direction=-1&limit=50`
* Spaces API: `GET /api/spaces?sort=likes&direction=-1&limit=50`
* Reused shared HTTP client (`build_client()`)
* Reused shared retry policy (`FETCH_RETRY`)
* Reused shared hash helper (`compute_content_hash()`)
* Added payload normalization + tag→topic filtering
* Added `health_check()` to both
* Registered both plugins via `arip/sources/__init__.py`
* Added comprehensive unit tests (fixtures captured from live API responses)

## Decisions

* D-004 — Source plugins must inherit `BaseSource` directly (no intermediate
  base class), because `__subclasses__()` does not recurse.
* D-005 — Per-source fetch limit / sort key are module constants when the SDS
  types the source as plain `SourceConfig`.

## SDS References

* §1.2  — explicit plugin registration
* §4.2  — `source_type` MODEL / SPACE, `content_hash` formula
* §5.3  — `BaseSource` interface, retry / 401 / 429 failure modes
* §5.4  — `normalize()` as a source method
* §5.5  — engagement signal, source authority 0.55 / 0.45
* §5.15 — both sources typed as plain `SourceConfig`
* §6    — mandated file paths

## Files Changed

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `arip/sources/huggingface_models.py` | NEW — Models plugin |
| `arip/sources/huggingface_spaces.py` | NEW — Spaces plugin |
| `tests/unit/sources/test_huggingface_models.py` | NEW — Models tests |
| `tests/unit/sources/test_huggingface_spaces.py` | NEW — Spaces tests |
| `arip/sources/__init__.py` | MODIFIED — 2 registration imports (SDS §1.2) |

No config change required: `SourcesSettings`, `settings.yaml` and
`ranking.source_authority` already declared both sources in Batch 1.

## Technical Debt

See TECHNICAL_DEBT.md — items TD-003, TD-004, TD-005 added by this batch.

## Validation

* SDS compliance reviewed
* Architecture review completed
* Pytest: **363 / 363 passed** (218 pre-existing unchanged + 145 new)
* Ruff: no new errors introduced
* No architecture violations detected

# Batch 5 – GitHub Trending Source

## Summary

Implemented the GitHub Trending source plugin according to the Frozen SDS and the approved Batch 5 scope.

## Implemented

* Added `GitHubTrendingSource`
* Added `arip/sources/github_trending.py`
* Added comprehensive unit tests in `tests/unit/sources/test_github_trending.py`
* Registered `GitHubTrendingSource` via `arip/sources/__init__.py`
* Reused shared HTTP client (`build_client()`)
* Reused shared retry policy (`FETCH_RETRY`)
* Reused shared hash helper (`compute_content_hash()`)
* Reused existing `BaseSource`, `RawSourcePayload`, `NormalizedItem`, `SourceHealth`, `SourceConfig`, and `SourceError` infrastructure
* Implemented `SourceType.REPO`
* Implemented GitHub repository payload normalization
* Implemented `health_check()`
* Preserved the existing explicit plugin discovery architecture
* No new dependency introduced
* No configuration schema changes introduced

## Decisions

* D-006 — Source plugins may read their own optional secret directly from `os.environ` when the existing plugin construction contract cannot provide an application-level secret.
* GitHub Trending uses the GitHub REST Search API as the data source.
* Trending is approximated using repository creation recency and descending star count.
* Per-source implementation constants remain module-level constants under the existing D-005 rule.

## SDS References

* §1.2 — explicit plugin registration
* §4.2 — `REPO` source type, GitHub slug identity, stars signal, content hash
* §5.3 — `BaseSource` interface and HTTP/retry/error handling
* §5.4 — source-level normalization
* §5.5 — GitHub source authority
* §5.15 — `github_trending: SourceConfig` and optional GitHub token
* §6 — mandated source file path
* §8 — Phase 1 source implementation scope

## Files Changed

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `arip/sources/github_trending.py` | NEW — GitHub Trending source plugin |
| `tests/unit/sources/test_github_trending.py` | NEW — GitHub Trending unit tests |
| `arip/sources/__init__.py` | MODIFIED — explicit plugin registration |

## Validation

* Pytest: **450 / 450 passed**
* Batch 5 Ruff check: **PASS**
* Configuration validation: **PASS**
* SDS compliance reviewed
* Architecture review completed
* Test review completed
* No new dependency introduced
* No unrelated files included in the Batch 5 commit
